# AudioModels
> Code created to explore audio models and data flows to potentially clean up audio

This repo includes a collection of test jupyter notebooks with code I wrote when learning more about audio data and audio models.  
I used Paperspace Gradient service, with PyTorch template, to create and run them.

Feel free to explore around.  
Most of the notebooks will include all the necessary setup (e.g. cloning external repos), but it's possible some files (mostly models) have to be downloaded manually.
